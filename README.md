# In a nutshell

An application that predicts a dog's breed from a user-provided image by using artificial neural networks.

![Capture](.\capture2.gif)

##  User interface
The web app follows this simple user story: 

* User uploads an image to the main page.
* if a dog is detected in the image, we display the predicted breed.
* if a human is detected in the image, we return the resembling dog breed.
* if neither is detected in the image, provide output that indicates an error and some suggestions.

## Prediction algorithms
The project's backend demonstrates the concept of [**Transfer Learning**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning) by leveraging existing models and pre-trained neural networks. These models are used to identify dogs or humans, and later to predict a dog's breed.


# Installation

Clone this repository, then cd into it

    $ git clone https://github.com/sbadillo/neural-networks-dogbreed.git
    $ cd neural-networks-dogbreed

It is recommended to set-up a virtual environment before installing all dependencies. 

To do so using using conda run:

    $ conda create --name dog-env --file --requirements.txt

Or (alternatively)  using venv & pip

    $ python3 -m venv env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the app

To start the web app in production, navigate to the /app directory and run the main app run.py

    $ cd app
    $ python run.py

alternatively, start a debug server with flask
    
    $ cd app
    $ flask --debug --app=run.py run --host=0.0.0.0

That's it! The app should be up and running. Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080 to try it.

(Or http://127.0.0.1:5000 if running the debug server).

### üóÉÔ∏è Project Structure and files
The project follows a simple structure. All necessary files to run the web server are found in the `app/` directory. For more insight into the thought process of the project go to the `notebook/` directory.

### Libraries


tensorflow and keras and Xception

    TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

    Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.

## Machine Learning techniques

### Dog vs Human differentiation

We start by defining whether our image contains a dog or not. Dog's detection is done by implementing the pre-trained Resnet50 model. This model has been trained on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/), a very large, very popular dataset used for image classification and other vision tasks.

If a dog is not detected, the algoritm attemps to find a human face. This is done by using dlib's mmod cnn model, a fairly accurate model for front-facing images. (Alternatively, the hog-svm model is used for faster results.)

### Dog's breed prediction
The implementation builds upon the [Xception model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357) (CVPR 2017). By using Xception as a base model, we can leverage it's pre-trained features on our particular problem. 

### Imagenet
ImageNet contains over 10 million URLs, each linking to an image containing an object from one of 1000 categories. Given an image, this pre-trained ResNet-50 model returns a prediction (derived from the available categories in ImageNet) for the object that is contained in the image.
